    "# Part II: Long-Run Economic Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-run economic growth: that is the subject of this two-chapter section. Chapter 4 covers, primarly, the the theory of growth. Chapter 5 covers, primarily, the worldwide pattern of economic growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section comes first for one reason: long-run economic growth is the most important topic in macroeconomics. The most important aspect of the economy considered as a whole, the macroeconomy, is that it grows—and grows faster and differently at some times and in some places than in others. Standards of living in the United States today are at least seven times what they were at the end of the nineteenth century. Successful economic growth has meant that almost all citizens of the United States today live better, and we hope happier, lives than even the rich elite of a century ago. The study of long-run economic growth aims at under  standing its sources and causes and at determining what government policies will promote or retard long-run economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognize, hoowever, that this two-chapter long-run growth section of the book, and the long-run growth portion of the discipline of macroeconomics, are, as modules, not very closely connected at all intellectually to the rest of the book and the subject. The rest is the study of business cycles, recessions, unemployment, inflation, and stabilization policy. Those are concerned with relatively short- and medium-run fluctuations that push production and employment down and up and make the economy perform less and more well as a societal institution for helping us attain well-being. Those studies that up by far the larger portion of this book—and of the discipline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the models used, the approaches taken, and the conclusions reached in this Part 2 section will by and large not be central to Part 3 and beyond, in which, starting with Chapter 6, we turn to business cycles.\n",

    "\n",
    "Look at it, but do not focus on the “long run” period of 3 to 10 years or so, in which prices have time to adjust to return the economy to a full-employment equilibrium but in which the economy’s productive resources do not change much—that’s what we will look at in Chapters 6 through 8. \n",

    "\n",
    "When we take this broad, sweeping view, it is clear that what we are calling long-run economic growth is _the_ only truly important factor determining the economy's potential for generating prosperity. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Figure 4.1 shows, material standards of living and levels of economic productivity today in the United States are more than three times what they are in, say, Mexico (and more than nine times those of Nigeria, and more than 25 times those of Afghanistan). These differences matter for more than just how comfortable people are: richer societies have much longer life expectancies in addition to higher levels of consumption and greater control over resources by typical citizens. Even a large economic depression would not reduce U.S. levels of prosperity to those of Mexico, let alone Nigeria or Afghanistan.\n",

    "At most a trivial part of them are due to whether unemployment in a country is currently above or below its average level, or whether various bad macroeconomic policies are currently disrupting the functioning of the price system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overwhelming bulk of these differences are the result of differences in economies’ productive potentials. The most important differences spring from differences in the level of technology and of organization currently used in production, which are themelves the result of differences in the skills of workers, the availability and competence of engineers and engineering knowledge, and the creation and maintenance of organizations with internal structures that impel them toward profductive efficiency. Secondary differences spring from differences in the presence or absence of key natural resources, and in the value of the capital stock—the structures and buildings, machines and programs, and inventories and work flows that have themselves been produced by humans earlier and are necessary for a productive economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enormous gaps between the productive potentials of different nations spring from favorable initial conditions and successful growth-promoting economic policies in the United States—and from less favorable initial conditions and less successful subsequent policies in Mexico and downright unsuccessful policies in Nigeria and Afghanistan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the bulk of today’s gap between living standards and productivity levels in the United States and Mexico (and Nigeria, and Afghanistan) opened up in the past century and a half; the bulk of success (or failure) at boosting an economy’s productive potential is thus—to a historian at least—of relatively recent origin. A century and a half ago U.S. GDP per capita was four times Afghan, not twenty times. While U.S. productive potential has amplified 13-fold since 1870, Afghan has only amplified two-fold and Nigerian five-fold. (Do, however, note that life expectancies at birth have more than doubled everywhere: humanity has done better at distributing the technologies that reduce infant mortality and enable longer life expectancy across the globe than it has done at distributing the technologies that boost production."

Europeans in large numbers were then migrating to Argentina, not Sweden—and Swedes were leaving their country in large numbers for greener pastures elsewhere, largely in the Americas. But economic policies that were mostly bad for long-run growth left Argentina far behind Sweden. The average Swede today looks to be more than sixteen times as well off in terms of material income as the average Swede of 1890. The average Argentinian today looks to be only between three and a third times as well off as their predecessor back in 1890.\n",

    "#### 4.1.1.2 The Factors Determining the Shape of Global Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "We classify the most important factors that generate differences in economies’ productive potentials into two broad groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, differences in the economy’s efficiency of labor—how technology is deployed and how organization is used to increase the amount of output a worker can produce with the same amount of capital and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second, differences in the economy’s capital intensity—how large a multiple of current production has been set aside in the form of useful machines, buildings, and infrastructure to boost the productivity of workers, even with the same technology or organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overwhelming bulk of these differences are the result of differences in economies’ productive potentials. The most important differences spring from differences in the level of technology and of organization currently used in production, which are themelves the result of differences in the skills of workers, the availability and competence of engineers and engineering knowledge, and the creation and maintenance of organizations with internal structures that impel them toward profductive efficiency. Secondary differences spring from differences in the presence or absence of key natural resources, and in the value of the capital stock—the structures and buildings, machines and programs, and inventories and work flows that have themselves been produced by humans earlier and are necessary for a productive economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other factors have played a lesser role since the coming of the industrial revolution, save for special cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economists have spent much time over the past two generations dividing economic growth into that part due to improvements in technology and in social and business organization that boost the efficiency of labor, on the one hand, and into that part generated by investment in capital to boost the economy’s capital intensity—the ratio of the capital stock to output—on the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "A very important finding is that, historically, investment that boosts capital intensity plays a substantial role in generating growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "But an even more important finding is that the lion’s share of economic growth comes from factors that affect the efficiency of labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this two-chapter section on economic growth, this first chapter, Chapter 4, sets out economists’ basic theory of economic growth due to MIT economist Robert Solow. It presents the concepts and models economists use to organize their thinking about the causes of long-run economic growth and stagnation. Chapter 5 then sketches the facts of economic growth over time and across the world. Chapter 4 is a tour of how economists think about economic growth. Chapter 5 is a tour of how economic growth is progressing or not progressing around the world.\n",

    "The biggest reason that Americans today are vastly richer and more productive than their predecessors of a century ago is that they have enjoyed an extraordinary ampli  fication of the efficiency of labor. Efficiency has risen for two reasons: advances in technology and in organization. We now know how to make electric motors, dope semiconductors, transmit signals over fiber optics, fly jet airplanes, machine inter  nal combustion engines, build tall and durable structures out of concrete and steel, record entertainment programs on DVDs, make hybrid seeds, fertilize crops with nutrients, organize assembly lines, and do a host of other things our predecessors did not know how to do. \n",

It has the forms of business organization, it has the stability and honesty of government, it has the schools to educate its population, and it has the other socioeconomic institutions needed to successfully utilize modern technology. So it is both better technology and advances in organization that have led to vast increases in the efficiency of labor and thus to American standards of living.\n",

    "## 4.2 The Solow Growth Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2.1 Model Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case for all economic models, the Solow growth model consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Variables_: economic quantities of interest that we can calculate and  measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Behavioral relationships_: relationships that (1) describe how humans, making economic decisions given their opportunities and opportunity costs, decide what to do, and (2) that thus determine the values of the economic variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Equilibrium conditions_: conditions that tell us when the economy is in a position of balance, when some subset of the variables are \"stable\"—that is, are either constant are changing in simple and predictable ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every economic model has a single key principal economic variable at its heart. We will be most interested in that one variable—the one the model is organized around.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the Solow growth model, the key variable is labor productivity: output per worker, how much the average worker in the economy is able to produce. \n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate output per worker by simply taking the economy’s level of real GDP or output Y, and dividing it by the economy’s labor force L. This quantity, output per worker, Y/L, is a very useful yet extremely simple proxy for the standard of living and level of prosperity of the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In every economic model—and the Solow growth model is no exception—economists analyze the model by looking for an equilibrium: a point of balance, a condition of rest, a state of the system toward which the model will converge over time. Economists look for equilibrium for a simple reason: either an economy is at its (or one of its) equilibrium position(s), or it is moving—and probably moving rapidly—to an equilibrium position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have found the equilibrium position toward which the economy tends to move, you can use it to understand how the model will behave. If you have built the right model, it will tell you in broad strokes how the economy will behave. In economic growth, the equilibrium economists lookfor is an equilibrium in which the economy’s capital stock per worker, its level of real GDP per worker, and its efficiency of labor are all three growing at exactly the same proportional rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equilibrium economists look for in the case of the Solow growth model is thus a balanced-growth equilibrium. In this growth equilibrium the capital intensity of the economy—its capital stock divided by its total output, K/Y—remains constant as the rest of the variables in the economy grow. The amount of capital that the economy uses to produce each unit of output remains constant over time, as both the capital stock and output grow at the same proportional rate, and thus capital intensity does not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each balanced-growth equilibrium, there is a balanced-growth path: this is a growing economy and so the economy’s variables of interest change over time. We need to know how fast it is growing: at what rate output per worker, Y/L, is increasing. So, after Ending the balanced-growth equilibrium, we calculate this balanced-growth path. Forecasting then becomes straightforward. If the economy is on its balanced-growth path, the present value of output per worker is on and future values of output per worker will continue to follow the balanced-growth path. If the economy is not yet on its balanced-growth path, it will head toward it: Over time, the economy will converge to its balanced-growth path.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how this works later on. First we need to set out the pieces of the Solow growth model.\n",

    "### 4.2.2 The Production Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with the average worker, a worker whose productivity is simply Y/L, the economywide average. This average worker uses the economy’s current level of tech  nology and organization. These are captured by the current value of the efficiency of labor E. This average worker also uses an average share of the economy’s capi  tal stock: He or she has K/L worth of capital to amplify his or her productivity. We want to analyze how these two — efficiency of labor E and the capital-to-labor ratio K/L—affect the average worker’s productivity Y/L.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we write down a behavioral relationship that tells us how the average worker’s productivity Y/L is related to the efficiency of labor E and the amount of capital K/L at the average worker’s disposal. \n",
    "\n",
    "We give this behavioral relationship a name: the production function. Tell the production function what resources the economy’s average worker has available, and it will tell you how much output the typical worker can produce. In the Solow Growth Model, we seek a production function that will satisfy two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A one percent increase in the capital at the disposal of the average worker—a one percent increase in K/L—will carry with it the same proportional increase in the level of labor productivity—of output per worker Y/L—with a factor of proportionality we will call α. (Note that, when we apply the Solow Growth Model, different economies will have different values of α; the same economy may well have a different value of α at different times; and asking \"what would happen if the value of the factor of proportionality α were different?\" is one of the principal what-if questions and exercises we will want to undertake and analyze.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A one percent increase in how well technology and organization are used to boost the productivity of the average worker—a one percent increase in the _efficiency of labor_, which we will label E—will carry with it a one percent increase in the level of labor productivity—of output per worker Y/L. (This is best thought of as a definition of what we mean by the _efficiency of labor_ E.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one and only one functional form that satisfies these two conditions. It is the so-called Cobb-Douglas function:\n",

    " \n",
    "where the factor-or-proportionality parameter α is a number between zero and 1. This tells us that the economy’s level of output per worker Y/L is equal to the capital stock per worker K/L raised to the power of a parameter α, and then multiplied by the current efficiency of labor E itself raised to the power (1—α).\n",

    "Let’s start with the case in which the capital stock per worker is $125,000. The Cobb-Douglas production function is\n",

    "In Chapter 6 we will talk in detail about the circular-flow relationship you learned in your Principles of Economics class: The amount of output an economy produces (real GDP, or Y) equals total spending, with total spending divided into four parts, consumption spending C, investment spending I, gov  ernment purchases G, and net exports NX, which equal gross exports minus imports, NX = GX — IM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will follow economists' custom of ruthless simplification, and assume that the workings of the circular flow are unproblematic. We will assume that total domestic saving S is equal to a constant parameter s times real GDP Y. And we will assume that total savings is unproblematically translated into investment I that adds to the capital stock:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ I = S = sY  $\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will assume that s is almost always constant. We may think about the consequences of its taking an upward or downward jump or two at some particular moment of time. The background assumption, however—made because it makes formulas much simpler—will be that s will remain at its current value as far as we look into the future. We call s the economy’s saving rate or, more completely, its saving-investment rate (to remind us that s is measuring both the flow of saving into the economy’s financial markets and also the share of total production that is invested and used to build up and increase the economy’s capital stock).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the saving-investment rate s is constant, the economy's capital stock K is not. It changes from year to year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adopt the convention of using a subscript when we need to identify the year to which we are referring. K<sub>0</sub> denotes the capital stock at some initial year, usually the year at which we begin the analysis; K<sub>3</sub> denotes the capital stock three years after the year at which we begin the analysis; K<sub>2003</sub> means the capital stock in 2003; K<sub>t</sub> denotes the capital stock when some year t is the current year; K<sub>t+1</sub> denotes the capital stock in the year after the current year; and K<sub>t-1</sub> means the capital stock in the year before the current year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time investment makes the capital stock tend to grow. But investment is not the only factor that changes the capital stock. There is depreciation. Over time depreciation makes the capital stock tend to shrink—old capital becomes obsolete, or breaks, or simply wears out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you will hear people refer to the change in the capital stock as net investment—investment net of depreciation—and refer to the amount of plant and equipment purchased and installed as gross investment. In this book “investment” will mean gross investment, and we will use “investment minus depreciation” in place of net investment\n",
    "\n",
    "We make a simple assumption for depreciation: The amount of capital that wears out, breaks, and becomes obsolete in any year is simply a constant parameter δ (lowercase Greek delta, the depreciation rate) times the current capital stock.

    "We can use either the algebra or the graphical method to think about the long- run consequences of, say, changes in a government’s fiscal policy. Before the 2000 presidential election the U.S. federal budget was in surplus and was expected to remain in surplus for decades. In the following few years, however, the George W. Bush administration pushed hard for significant increases in spending (which drove conservative small-government Republicans up the wall) and significant decreases in taxes (which drove liberal pro-government-program Democrats around the bend), with the result being a large downward shift in government saving SG and thus in the economy’s saving-investment rate s. Such a shift is going to mean that the equilibrium line rotates counterclockwise, and so the intersection point moves to a lower equilibrium value of output per worker. The economy’s equilibrium con  dition K/Y = s/8 will be satisfied at a lower capital intensity, and so the economy will be poorer.\n",

Thus equilibrium output per worker is constant. There is — in this particular, restricted case — no growth of output per worker when the economy is in equilibrium.

    "Earlier, when we had assumed that labor force and efficiency were both constant, and thus that n and g were both equal to 0, our equilibrium condition was K/Y = s/8. Since the saving-investment rate s and the depreciation rate 8 are both constant, our equilibrium condition required that the capital-output ratio K/Y be constant. Now we’ve added realism to our model by allowing the labor force and efficiency to both increase over time at constant rates n and g. What effect does this added realism — allowing n and g to take on values other than 0 — have on our equilibrium condition?\n",
    "In an important sense, none! Once again, our equilibrium condition is that the capital-output ratio be constant. When the capital-output ratio is constant, we say that the economy is in balanced growth: Output per worker is then growing at the same rate as the capital stock per worker. The two variables are in balance, and they are also both growing at the same rate as the efficiency of labor.\n",
    "But at what value will the economy’s capital-output ratio be constant? Here is where allowing n and g to take on values other than 0 matters. The capital-output ratio will be constant — and therefore we’ll be in balanced-growth equilibrium — when K/Y = s/(n + g + 8). Add up the economy’s labor-force growth rate, efficiency-of-labor growth rate, and depreciation rate; divide the saving-investment rate by that sum; and that is your balanced-growth equilibrium capital-output ratio.\n",
    "Why is s/(n + g + 8) the capital-output ratio in equilibrium? Think of it this way: Suppose the economy is in balanced growth. How much is it investing? There must be investment equal to 8K to replace depreciated capital. There must be invest  ment equal to nK to provide the labor force which is expanding at rate n with the capital it will need. And since the efficiency of labor is growing at rate g, there must be investment equal to gK in order for the capital stock to keep up with increasing efficiency of labor. Adding these three parts of required investment together and set  ting the sum equal to the investment sY actually going on,\n",

    "To see more formally that K/Y = s/(n + g + 8) is the balanced-growth equilib  rium condition requires a short march through simple algebra. Take a look again\n",

With output per worker growing at rate g and the number of workers growing at rate n, total output is growing at the constant rate n + g.5 For the capital-output ratio K/Y to be constant, the capital stock also has to be grow  ing at rate n + g.

But with the exception of a few years at the end of the 1990s, the U.S. government has run deficits. Then the government is “dissaving” — borrowing by running a deficit. G — T, government purchases minus net taxes, is the gov  ernment’s deficit. When the government runs a deficit, its saving SG is negative.\n",
    "IM — GX is simply the excess of imports over exports, which equals the net flow of saving that foreigners invest here. Call it SF, S for saving and F for foreign. With these new symbols, our equation above tells us that investment is equal to saving:\n",

In the end, there is no place that net saving can go but to finance investment. If you save it, and it gets into the hands of a bank, then unless some other household borrows it (and so offsets your positive saving with its negative saving) the bank will lend it out, and it will be spent on business investment.\n",
